# Solidity_Smart_Contract

Solidity Smart Contracts is an example of smart contracts designed to automate institutuions financial processes and features, such as
hosting joint savings accounts. To automate the creation of the joint savings accounts I have created a Solidity smart contract
that accepts two user addresses. These addresses are able to control a joint savings account. This smart contract uses ether management
functions to implement a financial institution's requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account and will consist of 
the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
